\section*{STARTED Abstract}
\label{sec:org66658f3}
\begin{description}
\item[{Objective}] From 2016 to 2017 the annual screen positive rate for
biotinidase deficiency in Ontario more than doubled from
2.65x10\textsuperscript{-4} to 6.57x10\textsuperscript{-4}.

\item[{Design and Methods}] A data mining approach was used to investigate the role
of temperature, filter paper lot, and print run on the screen
positive rate for biotinidase deficiency. The laboratory information
system was queried for all biotinidase activity results for the
period 2014-01-12 to 2018-09-27 (n = 678,354). During the study
period biotinidase activity was measured on the SpotCheck Pro
platform (Astoria Pacific, Oregon USA.) with results reported in
microplate response units (MRU).

\item[{Results}] Decomposition was used to separate seasonality from an
underlying trend in the 4 year time series of biotindase activity
results. This analysis revealed a marked seasonal effect (winter =
mean + <= 16 MRU, summer = mean - <= 19 MRU) and a profound
non-linear negative trend (max = 126.7 MRU, min = MRU). External
temperature was correlated with biotinidase results (Pearson's r =
0.79) but not with the observed negative trend (Pearson's r =
-0.06). Time series analysis of biotinidase results grouped by print
lot of filter paper revealed that recently printed filter paper
cards exhibit a time dependent inhibition of biotinidase activity
(observed in seven print lots over four years). This inhibition
resolved in approximately 3 months (Lot A: mean result 0-3.5 months
= 66.0 MRU, mean result 3-6 months = 90.3 MRU).

\item[{Conclusions}] In Ontario, lots of filter paper collection cards are
generally issued once a year. Due to operational changes in 2017
four filter paper collection cards lots were issued. These new
filter paper lots caused a pronounced negative trend in biotinidase
activity leading to an increased biotinidase deficiency screen
positive rate in 2017.

\label{sec:org41a3eca}
\begin{itemize}
\item Biotinidase deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder of biotin
recycling associated with secondary alterations in amino acid,
carbohydrate, and fatty acid metabolism (Figure \ref{fig:orgb68c26e}).

\item Biotinidase and newborn screening
\item Free biotin, whose primary source is the diet, is
actively transported across the intestinal membrane and blood–brain
barrier. This free biotin pool provides biotin to the various
apocarboxylases (pyruvate carboxylase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase,
propionyl-CoA carboxylase, and beta-methylcrotonyl-CoA
carboxylase). Holocarboxylase synthetase assembles active
holocarboxylases by covalently binding biotin to their active
sites. The carboxylases are important for gluconeogenesis, fatty
acid synthesis, and the catabolism of several branch-chain amino
acids. Eventually, the holocarboxylases are degraded proteolytically
to biocytin or small biotinyl-peptides. These compounds are further
cleaved by biotinidase to produce lysine and free biotin, which can
enter the free biotin pool, thereby recycling the vitamin. ACC,
acetyl-CoA carboxylase; AMP, adenosine monophosphate; ATP, adenosine
triphosphate; MCC, 3-methylcrotonyl carboxylase; PC, pyruvate
carboxylase; PCC, propionyl-CoA carboxylase; PPi, inorganic
pyrophosphate.
\item Biotinidase deficiency is caused by absent or markedly deficient
activity of biotinidase.

\item Biotinidase is a cytosolic enzyme that liberates biotin from
biocytin during the normal proteolytic turnover of holocarboxylases
and other biotiny-lated proteins.

\item Based on newborn screening outcome data from 2006, the incidence of
profound biotinidase deficiency in the United States is estimated at
1/80,000 births, and partial biotinidase deficiency between 1/31,000
and 1/40,000 (\hyperlink{citeproc_bib_item_4}{Strovel et al. 2017}).

\item Diagnosis of biotinidase deficiency is based on demonstrating
deficient enzyme activity in serum or plasma

\item Patients with profound biotinidase deficiency have less than 10\% of
mean normal serum activity (\hyperlink{citeproc_bib_item_4}{Strovel et al. 2017}).

\item Patients with partial biotinidase deficiency have 10-30\% of mean
normal serum activity (\hyperlink{citeproc_bib_item_4}{Strovel et al. 2017}).
\end{itemize}

\section*{Material and Methods}
\label{sec:orgedf3066}
A data mining approach was used to investigate the affect of
temperature and filter paper lots on the screen positive rate for
biotinidase deficiency. The laboratory information system was queried
for all newborn screening biotinidase activity results from the first
phase of screening for the period 2014-01-12 to 2019-07-27 (n =
798,770). During the study period biotinidase activity was measured on
the SpotCheck Pro platform (Astoria Pacific, Oregon USA.). Biotinidase
activity was reported in microplate response units (MRU).

Daily mean temperature data for weather station 42183 in Barrie
Ontario was downloaded from Environment Canada. Time series
decomposition was used to separate seasonality from an underlying
trend in the 4 year time series of biotindase activity results.

Whole blood samples were heat treated to reduce biotinidase
activity. The heat treated whole blood was then mixed with untreated
whole blood in a serial dilution to create a set of samples with a
range of biotinidase activity. Biotinidase acitivty in these samples
was measured after spotting onto filter paper lots w152, w161, w162
and 171 and allowing to dry at room temperature overnight.

The R language for statistical computing was used for all data
analysis with extensive use of tidyverse packages for data
manipulation, mcr for deming regression, xts and tsa for time series
analysis (\hyperlink{citeproc_bib_item_5}{Team 2020}; \hyperlink{citeproc_bib_item_6}{Wickham et al. 2019}; \hyperlink{citeproc_bib_item_2}{Fabian Model <fabian.model@roche.com> 2014}; \hyperlink{citeproc_bib_item_3}{Ryan and Ulrich 2020}; \hyperlink{citeproc_bib_item_1}{Chan and Ripley 2020}).

data analysis are available here:

\section*{Results}
\label{sec:orgf745ecf}
\subsection*{Time Series Analysis}
\label{sec:org7fa0ce9}
Time series analysis was performed to examine trends in biotinidase
and GALT activity over the four year study period. As expected both
analytes demonstrate seasonal variation in measured activity, as a
result the screen positive rate for biotinidase deficiency and
galactosemia increased in the warm summer months (Figure \ref{fig:org1950a25}
and \ref{fig:orgde74bbb}). However, there was a period in early 2017 when the
screen positive rate for biotinidase deficiency increased despite
external temperatures below zero (Figure \ref{fig:org1950a25} between the blue
lines). There is no corresponding change in the galactosemia screen
positive rate during this time period (Figure \ref{fig:org1950a25} between the
blue lines).

\subsection*{Season and Trend Decomposition}
\label{sec:org4865da1}
Season and trend decomposition was used to identify trends in
biotinidase activity after adjustment for seasonal effects (Figure
\ref{fig:orgd54bd2e}). Median weekly biotinidase activity revealed a marked
seasonal effect with higher activity in the winter (median + \(\le\) 17
MRU) and lower activity in the summer (median - \(\le\) 20) in addtion to
a non-linear negative trend during 2017 (Figure \ref{fig:orgd54bd2e}). External
temperature was correlated with biotinidase activity (Pearson's r =
0.81) but not with the observed negative trend (Pearson's r = 0.004).

\subsection*{Biotinidase Activity by Filter Paper Lot}
\label{sec:orgfe7844f}
Time series analysis of median weekly biotinidase results grouped by
filter paper lot revealed that filter paper cards exhibit a time
dependent inhibition of biotinidase activity, observed in seven filter
paper lots over four years (Figure \ref{fig:orgace0a4f}).

\subsection*{Inhibition of Biotinidase Resolved After 2 Months}
\label{sec:org295e592}
Direct comparison of measured biotinidase activity for whole blood
samples spotted onto a paper lot (w171) recently received from the
printers with material in circulation shows a notable negative
bias (Figure \ref{fig:org5c5bfc1}). Inhibition of biotindase activity resolved after two months
(Figures \ref{fig:orgace0a4f} and \ref{fig:org9ce1064}).

\section*{{\bfseries\sffamily TODO} Conclusions}
\label{sec:org6a00be5}

\begin{itemize}
\item In Ontario, new lots of filter paper collection cards are generally
issued once a year. Due to operational changes in 2017 three filter
paper collection cards lots were issued.
\item These new filter paper lots caused a pronounced negative trend in
biotinidase activity leading to an increased biotinidase deficiency
screen positive rate in 2017.
