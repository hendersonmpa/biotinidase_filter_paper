\item[{Objective}] This study set out to examine pre-analytical factors
affecting the frequency of positive results in newborn screening for
biotinidase deficiency. This investigation was prompted by an
increase in annual screen positive rate for biotinidase deficiency
in Ontario from 2.65x10\textsuperscript{-4} in 2016 to 6.57x10\textsuperscript{-4} in 2017.

measurements for the period 2014-01-12 to 2019-07-27 (n =
798,770). This analysis revealed a marked seasonal effect (winter =
median + <= 17 MRU, summer = mean - <= 20 MRU) and a non-linear
negative trend. External temperature was correlated with biotinidase
results (Pearson's r = 0.71) but not with the observed negative
trend (Pearson's r = 0.004). Time series analysis of biotinidase
results grouped by print lot of filter paper revealed that recently
printed filter paper cards exhibit a time dependent inhibition of
biotinidase activity. This inhibition resolved over time.

\item[{Conclusions}] Increased seasonal temperatures and collection on

\section*{Introduction}
\label{sec:org8dc339e}
This study set out to examine pre-analytical factors affecting the
frequency of positive results in newborn screening for biotinidase
deficiency. This investigation was prompted by a marked increase in
annual screen positive rate for biotinidase deficiency in Ontario from
2.65x10\textsuperscript{-4} in 2016 to 6.57x10\textsuperscript{-4} in 2017.

Biotinidase deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by
absent or markedly deficient activity of biotinidase.  Biotinidase is
a cytosolic enzyme that liberates biotin from biocytin during the
normal proteolytic turnover of holocarboxylases and other biotinylated
proteins. The absence of appropriate biotin recycling is associated
with secondary alterations in amino acid, carbohydrate, and fatty acid
metabolism (Figure \ref{fig:org6443af0}).

The state of Virginia was the first jurisdiction to perform universal
newborn screening for biotinidase deficiency, beginning in 1984 (\hyperlink{citeproc_bib_item_11}{Wolf 2015}). Biotinidase deficiency was added to the Recommended
Universal Screening Panel in the United States in 2006 and has been a
target disorder for newborn screening in Ontario since 2007 (\hyperlink{citeproc_bib_item_9}{Watson et al. 2006}).  Based on newborn screening outcome data from
2006, the incidence of profound biotinidase deficiency in the United
States is estimated at 1/80,000 births, and partial biotinidase
deficiency between 1/31,000 and 1/40,000 (\hyperlink{citeproc_bib_item_6}{Strovel et al. 2017}). Diagnosis of biotinidase deficiency is based on
demonstrating deficient enzyme activity in serum or plasma. Patients
with profound biotinidase deficiency have less than 10\% of mean normal
serum activity (\hyperlink{citeproc_bib_item_6}{Strovel et al. 2017}). Patients with partial biotinidase
deficiency have 10-30\% of mean normal serum activity (\hyperlink{citeproc_bib_item_6}{Strovel et al. 2017}).

Avoiding false negative newborn screening results is of paramount
importance in newborn screening. There is recognition that false
positive newborn screening results are also an adverse outcome of
newborn screening and need to be reduced for the benefit of families
and the healthcare system (\hyperlink{citeproc_bib_item_3}{Kwon and Farrell 2000}). A previous observational
study examining the affect of season on the screen positive rate for
biotinidase deficiency found no significant seasonal effect, this may
be due to differences in climate and screening thresholds (\hyperlink{citeproc_bib_item_8}{Thibodeau et al. 1993}). Controlled experiments demonstrate that
exposure to high temperature and humidity decreases biotinidase
activity. Evidence presented here demonstrates that increased seasonal
temperatures and collection on newly printed filter cards inhibits
biotindase activity results in an increased screen positive rate.

\section*{Material and Methods}
\label{sec:org2cca2fb}
A data mining approach was used to investigate the affect of
temperature and filter paper lots on the screen positive rate for
biotinidase deficiency. The laboratory information system was queried
for all newborn screening biotinidase activity results from the first
phase of screening for the period 2014-01-12 to 2019-07-27 (n =
798,770). During the study period biotinidase activity was measured on
the SpotCheck Pro platform (Astoria Pacific, Oregon USA.). Biotinidase
activity was reported in microplate response units (MRU).

Daily mean temperature data for weather station 42183 in Barrie
Ontario was downloaded from Environment Canada. Time series
decomposition was used to separate seasonality from an underlying
trend in the 4 year time series of biotindase activity results.

Whole blood samples were heat treated to reduce biotinidase
activity. The heat treated whole blood was then mixed with untreated
whole blood in a serial dilution to create a set of samples with a
range of biotinidase activity. Biotinidase acitivty in these samples
was measured after spotting onto filter paper lots W152, W161, W162
and W171 and allowing to dry at room temperature overnight.

This manuscript was prepared using the Org-mode environment for
literate programming and reproducible research (\hyperlink{citeproc_bib_item_5}{Schulte et al. 2012}). The R language for statistical computing was used
for all data analysis with tidyverse packages for
data manipulation, mcr for deming regression, xts and tsa for time
series analysis (\hyperlink{citeproc_bib_item_7}{Team 2020}; \hyperlink{citeproc_bib_item_10}{Wickham et al. 2019}; \hyperlink{citeproc_bib_item_2}{Fabian Model <fabian.model@roche.com> 2014}; \hyperlink{citeproc_bib_item_4}{Ryan and Ulrich 2020}; \hyperlink{citeproc_bib_item_1}{Chan and Ripley 2020}).

\subsection*{Time Series Analysis}
\label{sec:org0f1792a}
Time series analysis was performed to examine trends in biotinidase
and GALT activity over the four year study period. As expected both
analytes demonstrate seasonal variation in measured activity, as a
result the screen positive rate for biotinidase deficiency and
galactosemia increased in the warm summer months (Figure \ref{fig:orgbba20ce}
and \ref{fig:orgc17ec7c}). However, there was a period in early 2017 when the
screen positive rate for biotinidase deficiency increased despite
external temperatures below zero (Figure \ref{fig:orgbba20ce} between the blue
lines). There is no corresponding change in the galactosemia screen
positive rate during this time period (Figure \ref{fig:orgbba20ce} between the
blue lines).

\subsection*{Season and Trend Decomposition}
\label{sec:org9591fea}
Season and trend decomposition was used to identify trends in
biotinidase activity after adjustment for seasonal effects (Figure
\ref{fig:org584deb6}). This analysis revealed a marked seasonal effect with
higher activity in the winter (median + \(\le\) 17 MRU) and lower activity
in the summer (median - \(\le\) 20 MRU) and a non-linear negative trend
during 2017 and 2018 (Figure \ref{fig:org584deb6}). External temperature was
correlated with biotinidase activity (Pearson's r = 0.81) but not with
the observed negative trend (Pearson's r = 0.004).

\subsection*{Biotinidase Activity by Filter Paper Lot}
\label{sec:orga32af7a}
Time series analysis of median weekly biotinidase results grouped by
filter paper lot revealed that filter paper cards exhibited a time
dependent inhibition of biotinidase activity, observed in seven filter
paper lots over four years (Figure \ref{fig:org99e6407}). Due to a time sensitive
change in the filter paper collection card, lot W161 was put into
circulation soon after printing. Inhibition of biotinidase activity in
this card lot was most pronounced and took over 5 months to resolve
(Figure \ref{fig:org99e6407}, yellow line and Table \ref{tab:w161_months}).

\subsection*{Inhibition of Biotinidase Resolved After 2 Months}
\label{sec:org6aa610d}
Based on the observed inhibition of biotinidase activity with filter
paper lot W161 (Figure \ref{fig:org99e6407}, yellow line and Table
\ref{tab:w161_months}) a controlled experiment was conducted. Whole
blood samples were spotted onto a new filter lot (W171) and filter
paper lots in circulation (W152, W161, W162). Lot 171 showed a notable
negative bias (Figure \ref{fig:orgc4de0af}). Inhibition of biotindase activity by
filter paper lot W171 resolved after two months of storage in the
laboratory (Figure \ref{fig:org9b80348}).

\section*{{\bfseries\sffamily TODO} Discussion}
\label{sec:org9b86281}
This should explore the significance of the results of the work, not
repeat them. A combined Results and Discussion section is often
appropriate. Avoid extensive citations and discussion of published
literature.


\section*{Conclusions}
\label{sec:org2142f3a}
In Ontario, new batches of filter paper collection cards are
generally printed and issued to birthing centres once a year in
early July. Introduction of three batches of filter paper cards in a
short period of time caused a pronounced negative trend in
biotinidase activity leading to an increased biotinidase deficiency
screen positive rate in 2017. Filter paper collection cards that
have been sequestered for two months prior to use no longer inhibit
biotinidase activity.
