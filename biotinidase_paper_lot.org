* STARTED Abstract
- Objective :: From 2016 to 2017 the annual screen positive rate for
  biotinidase deficiency in Ontario more than doubled from
  2.65x10^{-4} to 6.57x10^{-4}.

- Design and Methods :: A data mining approach was used to investigate the role
  of temperature, filter paper lot, and print run on the screen
  positive rate for biotinidase deficiency. The laboratory information
  system was queried for all biotinidase activity results for the
  period 2014-01-12 to 2018-09-27 (n = 678,354). During the study
  period biotinidase activity was measured on the SpotCheck Pro
  platform (Astoria Pacific, Oregon USA.) with results reported in
  microplate response units (MRU).

- Results :: Decomposition was used to separate seasonality from an
  underlying trend in the 4 year time series of biotindase activity
  results. This analysis revealed a marked seasonal effect (winter =
  mean + <= 16 MRU, summer = mean - <= 19 MRU) and a profound
  non-linear negative trend (max = 126.7 MRU, min = MRU). External
  temperature was correlated with biotinidase results (Pearson's r =
  0.79) but not with the observed negative trend (Pearson's r =
  -0.06). Time series analysis of biotinidase results grouped by print
  lot of filter paper revealed that recently printed filter paper
  cards exhibit a time dependent inhibition of biotinidase activity
  (observed in seven print lots over four years). This inhibition
  resolved in approximately 3 months (Lot A: mean result 0-3.5 months
  = 66.0 MRU, mean result 3-6 months = 90.3 MRU).

- Conclusions :: In Ontario, lots of filter paper collection cards are
  generally issued once a year. Due to operational changes in 2017
  four filter paper collection cards lots were issued. These new
  filter paper lots caused a pronounced negative trend in biotinidase
  activity leading to an increased biotinidase deficiency screen
  positive rate in 2017.

* TODO Introduction
- Biotinidase deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder of biotin
  recycling associated with secondary alterations in amino acid,
  carbohydrate, and fatty acid metabolism (Figure [[fig:cycle]]).

- Biotinidase and newborn screening
- Free biotin, whose primary source is the diet, is
  actively transported across the intestinal membrane and bloodâ€“brain
  barrier. This free biotin pool provides biotin to the various
  apocarboxylases (pyruvate carboxylase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase,
  propionyl-CoA carboxylase, and beta-methylcrotonyl-CoA
  carboxylase). Holocarboxylase synthetase assembles active
  holocarboxylases by covalently binding biotin to their active
  sites. The carboxylases are important for gluconeogenesis, fatty
  acid synthesis, and the catabolism of several branch-chain amino
  acids. Eventually, the holocarboxylases are degraded proteolytically
  to biocytin or small biotinyl-peptides. These compounds are further
  cleaved by biotinidase to produce lysine and free biotin, which can
  enter the free biotin pool, thereby recycling the vitamin. ACC,
  acetyl-CoA carboxylase; AMP, adenosine monophosphate; ATP, adenosine
  triphosphate; MCC, 3-methylcrotonyl carboxylase; PC, pyruvate
  carboxylase; PCC, propionyl-CoA carboxylase; PPi, inorganic
  pyrophosphate.
- Biotinidase deficiency is caused by absent or markedly deficient
  activity of biotinidase.

- Biotinidase is a cytosolic enzyme that liberates biotin from
  biocytin during the normal proteolytic turnover of holocarboxylases
  and other biotiny-lated proteins.

- Based on newborn screening outcome data from 2006, the incidence of
  profound biotinidase deficiency in the United States is estimated at
  1/80,000 births, and partial biotinidase deficiency between 1/31,000
  and 1/40,000 [cite:@Strovel2017].

- Diagnosis of biotinidase deficiency is based on demonstrating
  deficient enzyme activity in serum or plasma

- Patients with profound biotinidase deficiency have less than 10% of
  mean normal serum activity[cite:@Strovel2017].

- Patients with partial biotinidase deficiency have 10-30% of mean
  normal serum activity[cite:@Strovel2017].

* Material and Methods
A data mining approach was used to investigate the affect of
temperature and filter paper lots on the screen positive rate for
biotinidase deficiency. The laboratory information system was queried
for all newborn screening biotinidase activity results from the first
phase of screening for the period 2014-01-12 to 2019-07-27 (n =
798,770). During the study period biotinidase activity was measured on
the SpotCheck Pro platform (Astoria Pacific, Oregon USA.). Biotinidase
activity was reported in microplate response units (MRU).

Daily mean temperature data for weather station 42183 in Barrie
Ontario was downloaded from Environment Canada. Time series
decomposition was used to separate seasonality from an underlying
trend in the 4 year time series of biotindase activity results.

Whole blood samples were heat treated to reduce biotinidase
activity. The heat treated whole blood was then mixed with untreated
whole blood in a serial dilution to create a set of samples with a
range of biotinidase activity. Biotinidase acitivty in these samples
was measured after spotting onto filter paper lots w152, w161, w162
and 171 and allowing to dry at room temperature overnight.

The R language for statistical computing was used for all data
analysis with extensive use of tidyverse packages for data
manipulation, mcr for deming regression, xts and tsa for time series
analysis [cite:@R2020;@tidyverse;@mcr;@xts;@tsa].

* Results
** Time Series Analysis
Time series analysis was performed to examine trends in biotinidase
and GALT activity over the four year study period. As expected both
analytes demonstrate seasonal variation in measured activity (Figure
[[fig:biotpts]] and [[fig:galtpts]]). As a result the screen positive rate for
biotinidase deficiency and galactosemia increased in the warm
summer months. However, there was a period in early 2017 when the
screen positive rate for biotinidase deficiency increased despite
external temperatures below zero (Figure [[fig:biotpts]] between the blue
lines). There is no corresponding change in galactosemia screen
positive rate during this time period (Figure [[fig:biotpts]] between the
blue lines).

** Seasonal Trend Decomposition
Seasonal trend decomposition was used to identify trends in
biotinidase activity after seasonal adjustment (Figure
[[fig:decomp]]). Median weekly biotinidase activity revealed a marked
seasonal effect with higher activity in the winter (median + \le 17 MRU)
and lower activity in the summer (median - \le 20) in addtion to a
non-linear negative trend during 2017 (Figure [[fig:decomp]]). External
temperature was correlated with biotinidase activity (Pearson's r =
0.81) but not with the observed negative trend (Pearson's r = 0.004).

** Biotinidase active by Filter Paper Collection Card Lot
Time series analysis of median weekly biotinidase results grouped by
filter paper lot revealed that filter paper cards exhibit a time
dependent inhibition of biotinidase activity, observed in seven
filter paper lots over four years (Figure [[fig:form]]).

** Inhibition of Biotinidase Resolved After 2 Months 
Direct comparison of measured biotinidase activity for whole blood
samples spotted onto a paper lot (w171) recently received from the
printers with material in circulation shows a notable negative
bias (Figure [[fig:spmat]]). Inhibition of biotindase activity resolved after two months
(Figures [[fig:form]] and [[fig:spmat2]]).

* TODO Conclusions

- In Ontario, new lots of filter paper collection cards are generally
  issued once a year. Due to operational changes in 2017 three filter
  paper collection cards lots were issued.
- These new filter paper lots caused a pronounced negative trend in
  biotinidase activity leading to an increased biotinidase deficiency
  screen positive rate in 2017.
